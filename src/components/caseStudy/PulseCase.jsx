                At the Pulse 'Ganesh Pandal', devotees will have the opportunity
                to interact with AI through a tablet. By describing their vision
                of Ganesha, the system will generate a customized visual of
                Ganesha, subtly integrating Pulse candy. This personalized image
                will then be projected on a large screen at the pandal, allowing
                everyone to witness the unique creation.
